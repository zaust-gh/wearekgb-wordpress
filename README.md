Based on the HTML5 Boilerplate created by Paul Irish and Divya Manian,
this allows for easy inclusion/removal of all HTML5 Boilerplate options.

This theme might look like a little bit of a quagmire at first blush because
it is a merger of two great themes with a very minor bit by me, but stay
with me, it'll all make sense in a bit, I promise.

## Description ##

Standing on the foreheads of giants (namely [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/)
and [Divya Manian](http://nimbupani.com/) and the good folks that have helped
them create and continue the growth of HTML5 Boilerplate, I present to you my
first WordPress theme, [Boilerplate - Starkers WP Theme](http://aarontgrogg.com/boilerplate/).
